# stock-analysis
module 2 VBA Challenge
#Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## This Analysis was created to help "Steve" determine the best direction to help his parents invest into the stock market. Using VBA we were able to distinguish which of the twelve stock options had a greater return rate performance in the years 2017 and 2018. Originally Steve's parents had wanted to invest in strictly "DQ" but further analysis showed other options should be investigated.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### The Stock performance between year 2017 and 2018 had some dramatic shifts.

### We can see here in 2017, the return rate for everything except "TERP" was a positive. This is further indicated by the green coloring of the table.

### The speed at which this program ran is 0.14 of a second, as shown in the picture above.

### The results for 2018 were far less encouraging, with ten of the 12 options seeing a negative return rate.

### The speed at which this program ran is 0.14 of a second which was the same as the time for 2017, as shown in the picture above.

### When compared side by side, it must be determined that the safest investment to see a return is ENPH

# Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

### One of the main advantages is saving time. When a code is input that has shown to previously have worked before, it can be just a matter of copying and pasting with minimal changes. A disadvantage may be, at least to new coders such as myself, the process of debugging. When a code is copied and set to a macro and doesnt work with the new set of data, much of the time was spent on trying to find the source of the issue. Rewriting all the data may be easier to a beginner. 

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

### The original VBA script was laid out in the module step by step, this made it easier for a begginer to see what each keyword, variable and other aspects meant to the process. Yet when those rules were varied and set to a different set of challenges, it became difficult to understand how to move the project forward. For example, the explanation of an Array was a bit confusing, and when four more sets were added for the challenge it was not immediateley clear that the last three DIMS would need the (12) included into the variable name. After some work with the TA's it made logical sense but to a new person coding it was a confusing peice that held up the whole project. 
### the Pros of rearranging and using the previous coding challenges to complete this project made it much easier once all the bugs were eliminated. While researching, I could see as well how answers to a question could lead to a rabbit hole of multiple codes. This can be confusing but it also showed the power of programming languages in general.
