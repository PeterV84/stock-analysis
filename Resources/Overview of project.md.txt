# Analysis of Kickstarter Project Campaign

## Analysis and Tools used

### This analysis showed the relative amount of success compared to failure of the Kickstarter Projects. Using tools throughout this module I was able to determine the Percentage funded and average donation amount based on Parent category sub-category. Using conditional formatting I was able to color the rows to see what was successful, what failed or what was canceled. I was also able to create a color scale in the percentage funded to visualize the success of funding based on the pledge goals.

## Challenges of the analysis

### Pivot tables were very valuable to assess the category statistics and multiple outcomes. Using these pivot tables allowed for easier transformation into charts and graphs to visualize the data in a different format. My biggest challenge was converting the pivot tables into charts and graphs. I am still learning how to manipulate the data and create a better visualization for the “stakeholder”.

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
-[x]The theater outcomes were most successful in May and Least successful to start and the year with especially high failures in October
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-[x]The most successful goal range was between 100-4999 as it had a 90% success rate and only 10% failure rate.
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
-[x]The Initial date range needed to be converted to one that excel could read which added another layer of difficulty. The specific details of who pledged would probably be useful in determining success and failure for future Kickstarter projects
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-[x]We could separate the amount of backers and compare that to the amount of pledged successes. We could also dig deeper into what did the best for each separate country as factors such as cultural impact and audience could play into what is a successful kickstarter in each country.
